# Doctor Booking System Implementation

This document describes the implementation of the doctor booking system for the MedDefi frontend.

## Features Implemented

### 1. API Route
- **File**: `src/app/api/doctors/[doctorId]/route.ts`
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/doctors/${doctorId}`
- **Returns**: Doctor object with `id`, `name`, `photoUrl`, `specialty`, `rating`, `bio`, and `services` array

### 2. Doctor Detail Page
- **File**: `src/app/patient/top-doctors/[doctorId]/page.tsx`
- **Route**: `/patient/top-doctors/${doctorId}`
- **Features**:
  - Displays doctor photo, name, specialty, rating, and bio
  - Lists all available services with prices
  - "Set Appointment" buttons for each service
  - Responsive mobile-first design with Tailwind CSS
  - Booking process overview sidebar

### 3. Appointment Booking Flow
- **File**: `src/app/patient/top-doctors/[doctorId]/[serviceId]/page.tsx`
- **Route**: `/patient/top-doctors/${doctorId}/${serviceId}`
- **5-Step Process**:
  1. **Schedule Appointment**: Date and time picker
  2. **Confirm Selection**: Review service and slot
  3. **Connect Wallet**: Trigger wallet modal
  4. **Escrow Payment**: Hold 50% in smart contract
  5. **Success**: Show transaction hash and appointment details

## Data Structure

### Doctor Object
```typescript
type Doctor = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  photoUrl: string;
  specialty: string;
  rating: number;
  bio: string;
  services: Service[];
};
```

### Service Object
```typescript
type Service = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  price: number;
};
```

## Navigation Flow

1. **Top Doctors Page** (`/patient/top-doctors`)
   - Lists all doctors with basic info
   - "View Profile" button links to doctor detail page

2. **Doctor Detail Page** (`/patient/top-doctors/${doctorId}`)
   - Shows complete doctor information
   - Lists all services with "Set Appointment" buttons
   - Each service button links to booking flow

3. **Booking Page** (`/patient/top-doctors/${doctorId}/${serviceId}`)
   - Complete 5-step booking and payment process
   - Progress indicator shows current step
   - Responsive design for all screen sizes

## Styling

- **Framework**: Tailwind CSS
- **Design**: Mobile-first responsive layout
- **Components**: Custom components with consistent styling
- **Icons**: Lucide React icons
- **Colors**: Blue theme with proper contrast ratios

## Key Features

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Grid layouts that adapt to screen size
- Touch-friendly buttons and interactions

### User Experience
- Clear progress indicators
- Intuitive navigation with breadcrumbs
- Loading states and disabled buttons
- Success confirmations with transaction details

### Booking Process
- Date picker with next 7 days
- Time slot selection (8 slots per day)

- Escrow payment flow
- Transaction success with hash

## Usage

1. **Navigate to** `/patient/top-doctors`
2. **Click "View Profile"** on any doctor card (e.g., Dr. Alice Johnson)
3. **See the dynamic page** load with that doctor's exact information
4. **Select a service** and click "Set Appointment"
5. **Follow the 5-step booking process**
6. **Complete the appointment booking**

## Testing the Doctor Selection Flow

### Available Doctors for Testing:
- **Dr. Alice Johnson** (Cardiology) - ID: `doc-1`
- **Dr. Bob Smith** (Dentistry) - ID: `doc-2`  
- **Dr. Carla Gomez** (Dermatology) - ID: `doc-3`
- **Dr. Daniel Lee** (Pediatrics) - ID: `doc-4`
- **Dr. Eva Martinez** (Neurology) - ID: `doc-5`

### Test URLs:
- `/patient/top-doctors/doc-1` - Dr. Alice Johnson's profile
- `/patient/top-doctors/doc-2` - Dr. Bob Smith's profile
- `/patient/top-doctors/doc-3` - Dr. Carla Gomez's profile
- `/patient/top-doctors/doc-4` - Dr. Daniel Lee's profile
- `/patient/top-doctors/doc-5` - Dr. Eva Martinez's profile

Each URL will display the specific doctor's:
- ✅ **Exact name** (e.g., "Dr. Alice Johnson")
- ✅ **Profile photo**
- ✅ **Specialty** (e.g., "Cardiology")
- ✅ **Rating** (e.g., "4.9")
- ✅ **Bio** (detailed description)
- ✅ **Services** (with prices and booking buttons)

## Future Enhancements

- Real API integration instead of mock data
- Actual wallet connection (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
- Smart contract integration for escrow
- Real-time availability checking
- Email/SMS confirmations
- Calendar integration

## Technical Notes

- Uses Next.js 14 App Router
- Server components for data fetching
- Client components for interactive features
- TypeScript for type safety
- Proper error handling and loading states
