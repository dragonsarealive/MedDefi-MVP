# Eliminated Features Documentation

This document tracks features removed during MVP simplification and provides requirements for future re-implementation.

## üèóÔ∏è MVP Architecture (Hybrid Approach)

**PRESERVED:**
- **Supabase Integration** - User authentication, profiles, onboarding (`src/lib/actions.ts`)
- **Blockchain Backend API** - Wallet management, practices, services, payments (16 endpoints)

**This hybrid approach allows:**
1. Users authenticate and set up profiles via Supabase
2. Once authenticated, they interact with blockchain features (wallet creation, service purchases)
3. Supabase user_id links to blockchain wallet user_id for seamless integration

### Core User Flows
1. **User Registration** ‚Üí `/wallet/create`
2. **Practice Creation** ‚Üí `/practice/create` (Medical users)
3. **Service Creation** ‚Üí `/service/create` (Practice owners)
4. **Service Purchase** ‚Üí `/service/purchase` (Individual users)
5. **Wallet Management** ‚Üí `/wallet/claim`, `/wallet/claim-status`

### Simplified UI Components
- Basic user registration forms
- Simple practice/service creation forms
- Service listing and purchase interface
- Wallet status and claiming interface
- Transaction confirmation displays

### Essential Pages Only

## üîÑ Re-implementation Priority

When ready to re-add features, implement in this order:

1. **Doctor Profiles** - Essential for trust and credibility
2. **Basic Calendar/Scheduling** - Core to medical appointments
3. **Invoice System** - Important for record keeping
4. **Complex Appointment Booking** - Enhanced user experience
5. **Advanced Dashboard Features** - Nice-to-have improvements

---

## üìã Technical Debt Notes

- Need to establish proper TypeScript interfaces for all eliminated features
- Consider state management solution (Zustand/Redux) for complex features
- Plan for real-time updates (WebSocket integration)
- Design for scalability with proper caching strategies
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
