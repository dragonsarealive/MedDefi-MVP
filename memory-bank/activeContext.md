# Active Context - Current Work Focus

**Last Updated:** July 25, 2025  
**Current Status:** Production Testing  
**Active Phase:** API Architecture Validation

## Current Work Focus

### üéØ Primary Objective
**Validate API route architecture in production environment** - ensuring the newly implemented server-side API routes properly handle Supabase environment variables and maintain security standards.

### üìã Active Tasks

#### ‚úÖ Recently Completed
1. **UI/UX Modernization (Completed)**
   - Implemented 2025 design trends with glassmorphism
   - Removed background image for cleaner focus
   - Added micro-interactions and animated gradients
   - Fixed text visibility issues in form fields
   - Enhanced user type selection with hover effects

2. **API Architecture Implementation (Completed)**
   - Created `/api/auth/register` endpoint for server-side operations
   - Removed static export configuration to enable API routes
   - Updated Netlify configuration for Next.js runtime support
   - Refactored client-side code to call API instead of direct database service
   - Fixed security vulnerability by keeping service role key server-side only

#### üîÑ Currently Testing
1. **Production Environment Validation**
   - Testing API route functionality on Netlify
   - Validating environment variable access
   - Monitoring transaction success rates
   - Checking error handling and logging

2. **Security Verification**
   - Confirming service role key remains server-side
   - Testing API endpoint security
   - Validating CORS and CSP configurations

## Recent Changes Summary

### Technical Architecture Changes
- **Moved from static export to API routes** for proper server-side functionality
- **Implemented secure environment variable handling** via server-side API endpoints
- **Enhanced Netlify deployment configuration** with Next.js runtime plugin
- **Separated client/server responsibilities** for better security

### UI/UX Improvements
- **Modern glassmorphism design** with backdrop blur effects
- **Enhanced form interactions** with focus states and micro-animations
- **Improved accessibility** with proper text contrast and visibility
- **Streamlined user experience** with reduced redundant content

### Security Enhancements
- **Server-side only database operations** via API routes
- **Proper environment variable scope** (client vs server)
- **Enhanced CSP policies** including WalletDash API endpoints
- **Eliminated client-side service role key exposure**

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Next 24-48 hours)
1. **Monitor production deployment** for successful API route functionality
2. **Test complete user registration flow** in production environment
3. **Validate blockchain wallet creation** and funding processes
4. **Check error handling** and logging in production

### Short-term Goals (Next Week)
1. **Performance optimization** based on production metrics
2. **User experience refinements** based on testing feedback
3. **Additional API endpoints** for other dashboard operations
4. **Enhanced error handling** and user feedback

### Medium-term Objectives (Next Month)
1. **Complete dashboard functionality** for both user types
2. **Advanced service management** features
3. **Enhanced transaction history** and analytics
4. **Mobile responsiveness** improvements

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Technical Decisions
- **API Routes over Static Export:** Chosen for security and functionality
- **Netlify Runtime over Static Hosting:** Required for server-side operations
- **Glassmorphism Design:** Aligns with 2025 UI trends and platform branding
- **Pre-filled Forms:** Improves user experience and reduces friction

### Business Considerations
- **Production Testing Phase:** Critical for validating architecture before scale
- **Security First Approach:** Prioritizing proper environment variable handling
- **User Experience Focus:** Modern design trends to attract and retain users
- **Scalable Architecture:** API routes enable future feature expansion

## Known Issues & Monitoring

### Issues Resolved
- ‚úÖ **Environment variable access in production** - Fixed with API routes
- ‚úÖ **Text visibility in form fields** - Added proper text color classes
- ‚úÖ **Static export limitations** - Removed for API route functionality
- ‚úÖ **Security vulnerability** - Service role key now server-side only

### Currently Monitoring
- üîç **API response times** in production environment
- üîç **Transaction success rates** for blockchain operations
- üîç **Error rates** and proper error handling
- üîç **User registration completion rates**

### Success Metrics
